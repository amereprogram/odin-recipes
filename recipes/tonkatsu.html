        Born from the union of Western influences with traditional Japanese cuisine during 
        the Meiji Restoration, <strong>Tonkatsu (とんカツ)</strong> has become a staple of home cooking in Japan 
        that's spawned a whole genre of crispy breaded dishes like Ebifry as well as dishes that 
        include a shatteringly crisp pork katsu as their base. Unlike Western breaded pork cutlets, 
        my Tonkatsu recipe uses thicker pork chops, which are coated in a thick layer of flakey..
